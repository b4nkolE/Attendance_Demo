# Attendance Demo

## Overview

**Attendance Demo** is a simple and extensible attendance management backend built using **Node.js** and **Express**.  
The project demonstrates a clean architecture with modular folders for configuration, controllers, database setup, models, middleware, and routes.

This project serves as a foundation for building more robust attendance systems (e.g., for classrooms, events, or workplaces).

## Features

- RESTful API endpoints for attendance-related operations
- Structured MVC-style project layout
- Database connectivity and models
- Middlewares for request handling and validation
- Easily extended with authentication, frontend, or mobile integration
